Paging
-----------

- in computer operating system, paging is a memory management scheme by which a computer stores and retrieves data from secondry storage for use in main memory
- in this scheme, operating system retrieves data from secondry storage in same-size block called pages
- paging plays important role in virtual memory implementation in modern operating system, using secondry storage to let programs exceed the size of physical memory.
- non-contigous memory allocation
- helps prevent external fragmentation
- page size = frame size
- logical address space is divided into equal size space of pages
- physical address space is divided into equal size frames
- logical address space or virtual address an address generated by the cpu
- physical address an address actually availabe on memory unit

Page table Implementation
-------------------------

1. page table is kept in main mamory
2. page-table base register (ptbr) points to the page table
3. page-table length register (ptlr) indicates size of the page table
